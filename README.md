It also have customized quizes to test the user's knowledge, and it also has a progress tracker to keep track of the user's progress. As it is an open source app, the AI is implemented using OpenAI's API to make LM Studio api, an app to run local AI models compatible, you can also use free Google AI Studio api if your computer isn't good enought to run a local AI model.
